Google Maps API Addons
======================

What you're seeing here is a compilation of scripts that enhance the
functionalities of the Google Maps API (currently in Version 3) in different
ways.

All scripts are open-source, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2 (see
LICENSE for details). Feel free to use the scripts in your own projects or
modify them according to your needs.

There are many live examples of the addons for you to try at
[marmat.github.io](http://marmat.github.io/google-maps-api-addons).
Furthermore the site contains reference docs in the style of the original
Google Maps JavaScript API documentation to make it even easier for you to use
the classes.

Here is a short overview of classes that are available in this repository.

#### DayNightOverlay

This class provides a custom overlay which shows an approximation of where
the day/night line runs at any given date.

#### SimpleMarker

An extremely lightweight marker class. The marker is trimmed down to the very
basic needs of a marker. In the DOM hierarchy, the marker is represented by a
single `div`-node.

#### PanoMarker

A marker which can be placed inside custom StreetView Panoramas. The marker
can be fixed to a position in the panorama image and thus moves with the
user's viewport changes.
